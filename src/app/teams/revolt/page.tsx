  introduction: `The SAE eBaja Club – Revolt Racers 1.0, established in 2024, is a student-driven team focused on the design and development of electric all-terrain vehicles for SAE eBAJA competitions. It brings together students interested in automotive engineering and provides a hands-on platform to apply theoretical concepts to real-world challenges.

The club aims to build competent engineers capable of designing efficient electric off-road vehicles through practical learning and innovation. Members work across key areas such as vehicle dynamics, powertrain systems, brakes, chassis design, electronics and manufacturing, gaining exposure to the complete vehicle development process.

Through participation in SAE eBAJA 2025 and 2026, the team has developed strong technical and problem-solving skills while working under real-world constraints.

What sets the club apart is its focus on end-to-end product development, where students are involved from initial design to final testing, helping them understand how real engineering projects are actually executed.`,

Overall Performance:
All India Rank: 36
Tamil Nadu Rank: 7
CFTI Rank: 2

Event Highlights

Static Events:
CAE Event – Rank 12
Sustainability – Rank 16
Cost Event – Rank 21
Sales Event – Rank 26
Design Event – Rank 34

Dynamic Events:
Sled Pull – Rank 18
Endurance Event – Rank 34

Other events such as acceleration and maneuverability were attempted but not ranked due to time limits, and suspension & traction was not cleared.`,
