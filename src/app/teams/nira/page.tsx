  introduction: `AUV SOCIETY IIITDM -We are a team of interdisciplinary undergraduate engineers working to 
build autonomous underwater vehicles for various underwater robotics competitions. The team 
works in the robotic domains of mechanical, electronics, and software. We aim to culminate our 
theoretical knowledge and use it to fabricate underwater vehicles that can traverse the depths of 
the ocean and function autonomously. AUV is a club with the vision of fostering innovation and 
research in underwater robotics. Our objective is to design and develop autonomous 
underwater systems capable of performing complex tasks such as navigation, object detection, 
and manipulation in underwater environments. 
The club provides hands-on exposure in domains like robotics, computer vision, embedded 
systems, control algorithms, and mechanical design. What makes AUV stand out is its strong 
interdisciplinary collaboration and consistent participation in national-level and international 
robotics competitions such as SAUVC (Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge)`,
