  introduction: `The MaRS (Mars Rover Students) Club , founded in 2020 , is a multidisciplinary student organization aimed at designing, building, and testing autonomous rovers and robotic systems that can operate in extreme terrains. With a strong focus on research, innovation, and real-world application, the club provides students with hands-on experience in mechanical design, electronics, software development, and systems integration.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world industry challenges, fostering innovation and equipping students to excel in global competitions.`,
