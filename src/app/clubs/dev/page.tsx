  introduction: `Developers Club, formerly known as Google Developers Student Club (GDSC), was rebranded in 2024 to reflect its broader vision and inclusive developer ecosystem.
The club serves as a dynamic platform for students passionate about technology, enabling them to explore and build across multiple domains such as Web Development, App Development, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Backend Development, Automation, Open Source, and System Design.

What makes Developers Club stand out is its strong hands-on culture and implementation-driven approach. Through hackathons, sessions, workshops, alumni talks, collaborative projects, and real-world system development, the club emphasizes practical exposure over theoretical learning. It fosters peer-to-peer collaboration, industry readiness, and a vibrant technical community within the institute.`,
