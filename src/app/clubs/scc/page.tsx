  introduction: `The Systems Coding Club is a technical community at IIITDM Kancheepuram dedicated to building strong foundations in low-level programming, hardware-oriented design, and real-world system development. The club focuses on practical learning, hands-on sessions, and project-based exploration to bridge the gap between theory and implementation. Organized into three wings — Embedded Systems, MATLAB & Simulation, and Verilog & Digital Design — the club conducts technical sessions and workshops on core and advanced topics, mentors juniors by building strong conceptual and practical knowledge, and empowers students with skills in microcontrollers, FPGA-based systems, signal processing, firmware development, and RTL design.`,
