  introduction: `The Robotics Club at IIITDM Kancheepuram is a student-driven community dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of robotics and automation. It unifies various branches of engineering and symbolises the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The club provides a platform for members and non-member students with a passion for robotics to come together and develop projects, participate in national-level competitions like Robowars, Flipkart Grid, and TechnoXian, and conduct workshops and technical sessions. "Inspire, Introduce, Initiate" is the mantra of the club. Members work across CS, ECE, and Mechanical teams on projects involving embedded systems, computer vision, control systems, and mechanical design.`,
