  introduction: `Founded in July 2025, our Game Development Community aims to bring the game dev
ecosystem to our college and support students passionate about creating games.
 We focus on all aspects of game creation — from art, design, and programming to storytelling
and music — encouraging members to explore their creativity through hands-on projects and
collaboration.
 What makes us stand out is our learn-by-doing approach, where members grow by participating
in game jams, building original games, and sharing knowledge across different domains of game
development`,
