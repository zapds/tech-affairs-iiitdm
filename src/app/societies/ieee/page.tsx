  introduction: `The IEEE Student Branch (SB) at IIITDM Kancheepuram was inaugurated on 27 October 2016 under the IEEE Madras Section. The branch was established with the vision of connecting students to the global IEEE network — the world’s largest professional association dedicated to advancing technology for humanity.

IEEE SB IIITDM K focuses on domains such as VLSI and Semiconductor Technology, Communication Systems, Embedded Systems, Antenna and Microwave Engineering, Signal Processing, Circuits and Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and interdisciplinary research.

The branch actively organizes international conferences, technical symposiums, workshops, hackathons, professional development sessions, and IEEE society chapter activities.

IEEE SB stands out for its strong research orientation, leadership opportunities, global networking exposure, and active student engagement in technological innovation.`,
