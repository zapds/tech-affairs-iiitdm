  introduction: `OPTICA (formerly OSA - Optical Society of America) is a globally recognized scientific society dedicated to advancing the study, application, and discovery in optics and photonics. The OPTICA STUDENT CHAPTER at IIITDM Kancheepuram was established in 2021 to bring together students passionate about light-based technologies.

The chapter promotes innovation, collaboration, and professional growth by organizing workshops, expert talks, industrial visits, and outreach programs. Through hands-on exposure and academic engagement, the OPTICA STUDENT CHAPTER aims to develop future researchers and engineers in optics and photonics.`,
